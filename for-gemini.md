Goal:
Loop though the nursing_homes.csv file and make a new copy of the template.html file to generate a new landing page for the specific nursing home that you're looping through. Change content, but do not change the style of the html. 

Rule:
1. Formatting Constraint: Do not use the asterisk (*) character for any purpose, including bullet points or bolding (e.g., avoid *item* or **word**).
2. Summarization Logic:
    * If an amenities list is present: Write a 1-2 sentence summary paragraph.
    * If no amenities list is present: Write a 3-4 sentence summary paragraph - DO NOT INVENT AMENITIES, it is okay to not list any. 
3. Summary Content: The paragraph must be a cohesive, flowing summary and must not contain truncated sentences or direct, unedited quotes from the source material.

4. I added the author tag at the bottom, I am Roger Amos, and I work for K&S computing. Do not remove it. Copyt it over to all pages.

5. Put all of these new files in a folder called generated

6.1 Run the script that I wrote for you to replace all instances of the example long and short name with the real name (only run this on the new file, not on the template)

6. do not use a script for this, manually copy over, summarize, and place the data. You can do a find and replace for Sample Name and the name of the nursing home, I made sure to leave the template consistent for you.

7. DO NOT overwrite the template file.
